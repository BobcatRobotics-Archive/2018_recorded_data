These files are the files are what were used in NE Champs for auto.

These files are not consistent between the xxxxxx.txt and xxxxxx.speeds.txt

Notable changes made during champs were:

   left2scale.txt   -- adjusted to not turn back to the switch so much,
                       and in-fact to turn toward the middle of the field
                       some.  Also elevator power adjusted to keep elevator
                       raised during 4-bar deployment.
                       same file copied into left2scale_2cube and _noswitch.

   left2scale_short_switch.txt  -- adjusted to really be a 1.5 cube auto,
                                   where we would try and grab the second
                                   cube, but stop after the cube was grabbed
                                   since we didn't want to risk a foul of
                                   ejecting cube while not touching switch.

   right2scale_short_switch.txt -- adjusted to really be a 1.5 cube auto,
                                   where we would try and grab the second
                                   cube, but stop after the cube was grabbed
                                   since we didn't want to risk a foul of
