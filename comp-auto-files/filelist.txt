File Descriptions:
center2left/center2right: Drive to left/right switch, drop off cube, turn and pickup
                          second cube and score in switch, then roll out to side of
                          switch for start of teleop.
center2right_simple: Drive to right switch *do not* eject cube and stop.  This file
                     is created by shortening center2right.
left2scale: Drive to scale backwards, turn and score cube in scale. Retract four bar
            and elevator, and wait for teleop. (Originally attempted to score cube
            on scale and switch if both on left, but uncertainty in robot position
            after scoring first cube on scale makes this too risky -- could hit
            scale or guard rail, etc.)
left2scale_noswitch : Now identical to left2scale. (Originally a a modification of
                      left2scale that didn't try and score on switch.)
left2scale2cube: Drive to scale backwards, turn and score cube in scale, taking care
                 to stay short of cable cover. Retract four bar and elevator, then
                 turn and pickup second cube and score in scale.
left2scaleright: If robot starts on left, scale comes up on right and cross is
                 enabled, then drive around switch and score cube on scale, then
                 retract four bar and elevator, turn and wait for teleop.
left2scale_short_switch: If robot starts on left, scale comes up on right and cross
                         is *not* enabled, and switch *is* on left, then drive
                         forward, turn and score cube in switch, turn and drive and
                         turn around to pickup second cube and wait for auto.
left2scale_short: If robot starts on left, and scale is on right, and switch is on
                  right, and cross is not enabled, then just drive forward and wait
                  with cube for teleop.  This file is also used if robot starts on
                  left, and robot has No Game Data (NGD)
right2scale...: Similar to left2scale files but robot starts on right.
