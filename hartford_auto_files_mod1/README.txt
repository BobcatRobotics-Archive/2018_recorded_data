These files are the files first set of mods to files that were used at
the Hartford competition.

These files are not consistent between the xxxxxx.txt and xxxxxx.speeds.txt

These files have the shortened left2scale_short.txt file made in the
championship match (but compare after pulling from rio).

And changes to the left2scale_short_switch that Dave B. proposed in email.
